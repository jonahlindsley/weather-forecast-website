# Weather forecast website  
  ***
  ## Discription 
  
  This is a website that I made to get the current weather and 5 day forecast. after a user inputs a city name the site uses two API requests to gather the data and then displays the current conditions for that city and 5 day forecast for that city. After a city is searched it is saved under the search bar for future use with 1 click.
